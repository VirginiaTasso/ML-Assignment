<p> The available data consists of 3000 observations, each dealing the initial and final states of separate observations. The parameters of each observations are the *average* of those parameters in the urban area. The microscopic values were not available.<p>

<p> The task is to use the available data to predict **flooded_final** columns for each sample in the test set. <p>
